As my internship progressed with these awesome Web guys at [34cross](http://34cross.in), I got exposed to a whole new world of programming, [__Haskell__](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).  It opens another paradigm called _Functional Programming_ and _Lazy Language_. Gosh! What are these?

So, I was told that [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com) is a good resource to get hold of all these concepts. I thought, why not give it a shot then? Yeah! Lets do some **Haskell**. :P

_(More coming soon...)_
